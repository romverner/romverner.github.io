        <h1>Companies that ONLY Donated to Trump</h1>
        <p>
            The below list depicts companies that donated <b>only</b> to
            Donald Trump or his Super PACs during the 2024 election cycle. It's 
            fairly common for companies to donate to both campaigns, but many 
            companies decided to make their stances very clear during the 2024 
            election cycle. Use this list to align your wallet with your values
            as you see fit.
