### 46 Peaks: Expedition Journal
This website/app is designed to help users plan their trip to the Adirondacks.
The original scope of the website was too complex for the given timeframe given to complete this project.
Using the map and labeled peaks, users can help plan their trip with up-to-date weather information.
Users can also submit guestbook entries, for which they also have the option to email them to recipients.
In the future the project will be expanded to include individual user logins and personalized journals.
