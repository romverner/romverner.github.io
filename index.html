                    Dobry den! That's hello in Czech, my home-country and native language! I am a software developer working out of the 
                    Philadelphia area. I've lived around Philadelphia for most of my life -- with the exception of a brief-stint of college.
                    My parents and I moved here when I was just five years old. I am now officially a dual-citizen -- US and Czech.
                    I'm currently enrolled in the Penn LPS Coding Bootcamp, learning full-stack development, with the aims of
                    a undergoing a career-change from the hard-sciences to more applied fields.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I currently work at Penn as a research specialist and lab manager. Living and working in University City has its perks.
                    There's a Boston Market more-or-less on campus, which I have been known to frequent -- I seriously couldn't tell you
                    why I love Boston Market so much, it's just a fact of life. I like to go on runs, hang out with friends, go to concerts,
                    and go on hikes. I'm very interested in car-culture, and follow it pretty extensively. One day I'll buy a Volksagen GTI (...
                    one day). I'm pretty awful at writing biographies, or 'About Me' pages, as it turns out! Feel free to contact me with any questions!
